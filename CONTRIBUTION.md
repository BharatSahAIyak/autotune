# Contributing to AutoTune

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to AutoTune! This guide outlines the process for contributing to the AutoTune project, ensuring a seamless experience for contributors and maintainers alike.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and have familiarized yourself with the AutoTune project by reading the documentation and exploring the issues.

### Issues

- **Browse existing issues** to see if someone else has already reported your issue or requested a similar feature.
- **Create a new issue** if you have a bug report, feature request, or proposal. Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce if reporting a bug.

## Making Contributions

To contribute to AutoTune, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Set up your environment** following the setup instructions in the README.
4. **Create a new branch** for your contributions. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `fix-issue-123` or `feature-add-x`.
5. **Make your changes**. Ensure you follow the coding standards and write necessary tests if applicable.
6. **Commit your changes**. Use clear and concise commit messages, including a reference to the related issue (if any).
7. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub.
8. **Submit a pull request** (PR) against the `main` branch of the AutoTune repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and reference the related issue(s).
9. **Respond to feedback**. The AutoTune maintainers will review your PR and may request changes. Continue to push updates to your branch until the PR is approved.

### Code Review Process

- The AutoTune maintainers will review all PRs. We aim to review and respond to PRs within one week.
- PRs that pass the initial review will be tagged for testing and further review.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.
